Bootleg slacktyping for Discord, demo in url above

Dependencies: express, discord.js, promise, async-sleep and dotenv

Just npm install and you're fine

#Installation
If you want to run this on your own then you need to create a application on discord then make it a bot account.

Reveal the bot's secret token then paste it into .env (make sure there aren't any spaces)

Do `npm install` and `node server.js`

It *might* run if you did that correctly

#Additional info
procfile is included if you want to run this on heroku for some reason

Code is not optimised at all but it takes less than 500mb of memory to run on heroku so I'm happy

Test bot will go down for like 1/3 of the last of the month since the bot is hosted on the free plan
